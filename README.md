develop a banking application. The banking application allows the user, i.e., the bank employee to create a bank account for a specific client. It allows him to list all the available bank accounts. For each account, it allows him to display the account details, withdraw money and deposit money. There are two types of bank accounts. The first type is the basic BankAccount.
